Mathematical Formulation
************************

For the second example, we consider the problem of determining the
unloaded configuration of a material given the loaded configuration
and the loads that it is undergoing. The loaded geometry desired here
is an L-shape as shown in Figure :numref:`figure-lshape-original`.

.. _figure-lshape-original:

.. figure:: /_static/figures/lshape-original_mesh.png
   :scale: 25 %

   The mesh of the loaded configuration.

In other words, we want the material to take this shape after applying
the distributed load given by :math:`\bar{\mathbf{p}} = -10^6` N/m at
:math:`x = 1`, and imposing a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition
at :math:`y = 1`.

Because this is an inverse elastostatics problem, the Cauchy stress
tensor is given by

.. math::

   \mathbf{T} = -\left[p + \frac{1}{3} \mu
      j^{-1/3} i_2 \right]
      \mathbf{I} + \mu j^{5/3} \mathbf{c}^{-1},

where :math:`j = \det{\mathbf{f}}`, :math:`\mathbf{c} =
\mathbf{f}^T\mathbf{f}`, and :math:`i_2` is the invariant of
:math:`\mathbf{f}` with :math:`\mathbf{f} = \mathbf{F}^{-1}`. Further
details of the formulation of an inverse elastostatics problem can be
found in Govindjee et al. :cite:`govindjeemihalic1996`.


Code
****

First, we import FEniCS Mechanics with the alias :code:`fm`.

.. code-block:: python

   import fenicsmechanics as fm

Now we get the name of the files storing the mesh and the boundary
tagging by using the :code:`get_mesh_file_names` function provided.

.. code-block:: python

   mesh_file, boundaries = fm.get_mesh_file_names("lshape", ret_facets=True,
                                                  refinements="fine")

Next, we start to define the problem defined before. We do this by
defining the :code:`config` dictionary all at once. Here we
will traverse it line by line:

.. code-block:: python

   config = {

First up is the material subdictionary.

.. code-block:: python

       'material':
       {

The problem is of an elastic material. Thus,

.. code-block:: python

          'type': 'elastic',

We will be using the neo-Hookean constitutive equation. This model is
already implemented in the :code:`materials` submodule, so we
can just provide a string.

.. code-block:: python

          'const_eqn': 'neo_hookean',

We must also let FEniCS Mechanics know that we wish to model the
material as incompressible.

.. code-block:: python

          'incompressible': True,

Given the formulation above for the incompressibility constraint, we
must provide the bulk modulus of the material.

.. code-block:: python

          'kappa': 10e9,

Also, the shear modulus of the material is provided.

.. code-block:: python

          'mu': 1.5e6
       },

Now that the material has been specified, we tell FEniCS Mechanics
where the files containing the mesh and the boundary tags are
located. This is where we use the variable :code:`mesh_dir`
that we defined before.

.. code-block:: python

       'mesh': {
           'mesh_file': mesh_file,
           'boundaries': boundaries
       },

Last, but not least, is the formulation used to define the weak form
for the problem.

.. code-block:: python

       'formulation': {

First, we tell FEniCS Mechanics that we wish to linear finite elements
for both the displacement and the pressure.

.. code-block:: python

           'element': 'p1-p1',

Then, we specify that the mathematical formulation should be done in
the reference (Lagrangian) configuration.

.. code-block:: python

           'domain': 'lagrangian',

We want to use the inverse elastotatics formulation as in
:cite:`govindjeemihalic1996`. Thus, we define this as an inverse
problem.

.. code-block:: python

           'inverse': True,

Now, we define the boundary conditions. First up are the Dirichlet
boundary conditions.

.. code-block:: python

           'bcs': {
               'dirichlet': {

We will apply a homogeneous boundary condition at :math:`y = 1`.

.. code-block:: python

                   'displacement': [[0., 0.]],

To identify this region, we must use the same tags that were provided
for the :code:`'boundaries'`. In this case, this region was tagged
with the integer 1.

.. code-block:: python

                   'regions': [1]
               },

Next, we define the Neumann boundary conditions.

.. code-block:: python

               'neumann': {

We are applying a Cauchy traction of :math:`\mathbf{p} = -10^5
\mathbf{e}_2` at :math:`x = 1`.

.. code-block:: python

                   'values': [[0., -1e5]],
                   'regions': [2],
                   'types': ['cauchy']
               }
           }
       }
   }


Below is the definition of the :code:`config` dictionary all
together:

.. code-block:: python

   config = {
       'material':
       {
           'type': 'elastic',
           'const_eqn': 'neo_hookean',
           'incompressible': True,
           'kappa': 10e9,
           'mu': 1.5e6
       },
       'mesh': {
           'mesh_file': mesh_file,
           'boundaries': boundaries
       },
       'formulation': {
           'element': 'p1-p1',
           'domain': 'lagrangian',
           'inverse': True,
           'bcs': {
               'dirichlet': {
                   'displacement': [[0., 0.]],
                   'regions': [1]
               },
               'neumann': {
                   'values': [[0., -1e5]],
                   'regions': [2],
                   'types': ['cauchy']
               }
           }
       }
   }

Now, we can create a :code:`SolidMechanicsProblem` object to
define the necessary UFL objects for the problem we have defined.

.. code-block:: python

   problem = fm.SolidMechanicsProblem(config)

Last, we define the solver object by passing in the problem object and
the name of the file we wish to save the displacement in, and tell
FEniCS Mechanics to solve our problem.

.. code-block:: python

   solver = fm.SolidMechanicsSolver(problem, fname_disp="results/unloaded_config.pvd")
   solver.full_solve()

This solution is shown in Figure :numref:`figure-lshape-unloaded`.

.. _figure-lshape-unloaded:

.. figure:: /_static/figures/lshape-unloaded_soln.png
   :scale: 25 %

   The loaded configuration desired (transparent gray) along with the
   solution to the inverse elastostatics problem (color contour).


Now, to see how well the formulation of the inverse elastostatics
problem works, we will reload the material. First, we import the
:code:`ALE` submodule from :code:`dolfin` to move the
mesh based on the solution of the *inverse* problem, as well as
the :code:`Mesh` class to create a copy of an existing mesh.

.. code-block:: python

   from dolfin import ALE, Mesh

Now, move the mesh and create a deep copy.

.. code-block:: python

   ALE.move(problem.mesh, problem.displacement)
   mesh_copy = Mesh(problem.mesh)

Note that we can use the same :code:`config` variable by only
changing necessary variables. First, we provide it with the mesh copy.

.. code-block:: python

   config['mesh']['mesh_file'] = mesh_copy

Then, we change the *inverse* flag to :code:`False`, since we
are interested in solving the forward problem.

.. code-block:: python

   config['formulation']['inverse'] = False

Now, create new problem and solver objects, and solve the problem.

.. code-block:: python

   problem = fm.SolidMechanicsProblem(config)
   solver = fm.SolidMechanicsSolver(problem, fname_disp="results/loaded_config.pvd")
   solver.full_solve()

The solution to the reloading problem is shown in Figure
:numref:`figure-lshape-reloaded`.

.. _figure-lshape-reloaded:

.. figure:: /_static/figures/lshape-reloaded_soln.png
   :scale: 25 %

   The loaded configuration starting with the solution to the inverse
   elastostatics problem.

It is clear that reloading the solution to the inverse elastostatics
problem yields a geometry that is nearly identical to the desired
unloaded configuration.
